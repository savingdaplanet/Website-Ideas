<h2><i>Leaders of The Century</i></h2>
<p>Throughout history war heroes such as <i>Alexander the Great</i> have led the common people in plummaging Rome's neighboring land. His speeches echoe throughout the ages bearing him the title "Alexnader the Great"</p>
<blockquote cite ="https://www.artofmanliness.com/speech-of-alexander-the-great/">
    <p>I could not have blamed you for being the first to lose heart if I, your commander, had not shared in your exhausting marches and your perilous campaigns; it would have been natural enough if you had done all the work merely for others to reap the reward. But it is not so. You and I, gentlemen, have shared the labour and shared the danger, and the rewards are for us all. The conquered territory belongs to you; from your ranks the governors of it are chosen; already the greater part of its treasure passes into your hands, and when all Asia is overrun, then indeed I will go further than the mere satisfaction of our ambitions: the utmost hopes of riches or power which each one of you cherishes will be far surpassed, and whoever wishes to return home will be allowed to go, either with me or without me. I will make those who stay the envy of those who return.</p>
